Make sure you have a project set up with the following dependencies:

React 18+ for building the UI.
TypeScript for type safety.
Tailwind CSS for styling.
React Hook Form for form handling and validation.
Zod or Joi for JSON schema validation.
Playwright/Jest for testing (optional at this stage).

step : 1
npx create-react-app json-form-editor --template typescript
cd json-form-editor
npm install tailwindcss react-hook-form zod

step : 2 
Run npx tailwindcss init to create the tailwind.config.js.

step : 3
We will create a proper interface to define the structure of the JSON schema, using TypeScript for type safety.

:- This JSONSchema interface represents a form with a title, description, and a list of fields. Each JSONField defines an individual field with properties like type, label, name, required, and optionally options (for fields like select dropdowns).

:- To handle any unexpected errors, you can create an Error Boundary to wrap the components and gracefully handle errors.

:- Use TypeScript for type safety by defining clear interfaces for the JSON schema and form fields.
   Validate the JSON gracefully with Zod.
   Generate forms dynamically based on the JSON schema
